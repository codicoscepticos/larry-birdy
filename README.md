# Larry Birdy

`Larry Birdy` is based on ['birdy'](https://github.com/inueni/birdy) and offers syntactic sugar. Through an experimental (and fuzzy oop design) and proof-of-concept way, you can make API calls with exprensiveness (and verbosity).

Note: It's not ready, yet. This respositery is just a placeholder.
